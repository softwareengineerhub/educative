Why do we need read lock if have only read operations ?

If your program truly only ever reads immutable data, then you don’t need any lock.
Multiple threads can safely read shared immutable state concurrently.

But in practice, things are usually more nuanced:
1) Data may look read-only, but might be updated at some point.
2) You may want a lock to ensure readers don’t see inconsistent or partially updated state.
3) Libraries or frameworks sometimes expose ReentrantReadWriteLock so you’re prepared for future writes.
