Why recursion does NOT automatically mean O(n²)
People often think:
“Recursion = loop inside loop = O(n²)”
That’s not true unless:
Each recursive call processes the same characters again
In a correct expression parser:
Each recursive call works on a different part of the string
No character is reprocessed by another call
So the work is distributed, not duplicated.

1. Visualizing the work
Imagine the string as positions:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
( 3 + 5 ) * 2 + ( 6 - 3 )
The outer call processes everything
When it hits (, it hands off the work inside to a recursive call
That recursive call finishes and returns
Control continues from where it left off
Key point:
Every character is “handled” once total, not once per recursion level.

2. Mathematical intuition
Let:
n = length of the expression
Total work:
work(char 1) + work(char 2) + ... + work(char n)
Each work(char i) is O(1)
